    "description": "A new OpenFOAM solver, called interThermalRadConvFoam, to simulate free-surface viscous fluids with temperature changing due to radiative, convective, and conductive heat exchanges. The solver is accompained by two test cases, one is a benchmark and the other one is the simulation of a lava flow on a real topography",
